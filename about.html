        <p> My name is Ahmed Dewan, a dedicated microbiologist with over 5 years of progressive experience in both academic research and the pharmaceutical industry. 
        My academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Microbiology and Chemistry from Zagazig University, Egypt, followed by an M.Sc. in Medical Microbiology, 
         where I investigated the molecular characterization and phage biocontrol of multi-drug-resistant MRSA. Nowadays, I am pursuing a Diploma in Bioinformatics at EgCompBio Academy, 
        which has deepened my interest in computational approaches to biological problems. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in microbiology 
            and an eagerness to explore interdisciplinary solutions. Currently, I am a research assistant at the Life Science School in China since 2023, 
            where I continue to engage in innovative research aimed at addressing challenges in microbiology and public health. 
            I am passionate about advancing our understanding of microbial interactions and developing solutions that benefit society.</p>  

            
        <p>I am passionate about science communication and have delivered numerous online sessions, including topics on antibiotic resistance, scientific writing, and transitioning from industry to 
        academia. As a social media mentor, I engage with a wide audience, sharing educational content and tutorials, which has garnered over 35,000 followers across various platforms.
        As a passionate advocate for scientific communication, I have delivered numerous online sessions  on topics such as antibiotic resistance and effective scientific writing. I also engage with a broad 
        audience on social media, sharing insights and tutorials in microbiology and research  methodologies. I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in research and development, 
        particularly in projects aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance, infectious diseases, and enhancing public health.<p>
