             <p>My name is Ahmed Dewan, My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in microbiology and chemistry from the Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Egypt, where I developed a foundational 
                 understanding of microbial identification, and characterization of pathogenic 
                  and beneficial microorganisms.  Immediately following my graduation, began my master‚Äôs degree while gaining practical experience in various microbiology-related fields, especially antibiotic resistance area. <p>
                  
            <p> I hold a Master‚Äôs degree in Medical Microbiology from Zagazig University, where I focused my thesis on the molecular characterization of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). My 
                  academic background is complemented by a strong publication record, including several papers on antimicrobial agents and microbiome research.
                    I worked on antibiotic resistance bacteria</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a research assistant at the Life Science School in China since 2023, where I continue to engage in innovative research aimed at addressing challenges
              in microbiology and public health. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of microbial interactions and developing solutions that benefit society.</p>  
         <p>I am a dedicated microbiologist with over 5 years of progressive experience in both academic research and the pharmaceutical industry. Currently serving as a Research Fellow at Anhui Agriculture 
              University, I specialize in microbiology, with a focus on antimicrobial resistance, metabolites, and fermentation.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about science communication and have delivered numerous online sessions, including topics on antibiotic resistance, scientific writing, and transitioning from industry to 
        academia. As a social media mentor, I engage with a wide audience, sharing educational content and tutorials, which has garnered over 35,000 followers across various platforms.</p>
       <p>As a passionate advocate for scientific communication, I have delivered numerous online sessions  on topics such as antibiotic resistance and effective scientific writing. I also engage with a broad 
         audience on social media, sharing insights and tutorials in microbiology and research  methodologies.<p>
        <p> üõëCore Expertise:<p>

<p>‚û°Ô∏èMicrobiology: Proficient in culturing techniques, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and bacteriophage characterization. Experienced in media preparation, microbial isolation, and food microbiology.<p>
<p>‚û°Ô∏èMolecular Biology: Skilled in DNA/RNA extraction, gel electrophoresis, gene expression analysis, and RT-PCR techniques.<p>
<p>‚û°Ô∏èTechnology and Software: Familiar with the NCBI database, MS Office, R programming, and tools like Canva and BioRender for scientific visualization.<p>
<p>‚û°Ô∏èIndustrial Practices: Experienced in creating Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), conducting sterility and endotoxin tests, and applying Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).<p>
   
   <p> I am actively seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in research and development, particularly in projects aimed at combating antimicrobial resistance, infectious diseases, and enhancing public 
 health.<p>
