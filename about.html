        <p>My name is Ahmed Dewan, My academic journey began with a bachelor's degree in microbiology and chemistry from the Faculty of Science, 
            Zagazig University, Egypt, where I developed a foundational understanding of microbial identification, and characterization of pathogenic 
            and beneficial microorganisms.  Immediately following my graduation, began my master’s degree while gaining practical experience in various 
            microbiology-related fields, especially antibiotic resistance area.</p>
            
         <p>Throughout this time, I got a comprehensive background in industrial and academic fieldI worked as a food microbiologist, 
             where I focused on ensuring the safety and quality of food products. 
             I also served as a microbiology specialist in the sterile area of the pharmaceutical industry, contributing to critical processes 
             that uphold stringent safety standards.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I completed my master’s degree at a Life Science School in China, specializing in microbiology and molecular biology. My research explored food microbiology 
        and natural products, further enhancing my expertise in the field.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am a research assistant at the Life Science School in China since 2023, where I continue to engage in innovative research aimed at addressing challenges
        in microbiology and public health. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of microbial interactions and developing solutions that benefit society.</p>
