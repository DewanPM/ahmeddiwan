        <p>My name is Ahmed Dewan, and I am a microbiologist with a comprehensive background in industrial and academic field. 
            I graduated from the Faculty of Science in 2017, earning a degree in Microbiology and Chemistry. Immediately following my graduation, 
            began my master’s degree while gaining practical experience in various microbiology-related fields, especially antibiotic resistance area.</p>
        
         <p>Throughout this time, I worked as a food microbiologist, where I focused on ensuring the safety and quality of food products. 
             I also served as a microbiology specialist in the sterile area of the pharmaceutical industry, contributing to critical processes 
             that uphold stringent safety standards.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I completed my master’s degree at a Life Science School in China, specializing in microbiology. My research explored food microbiology 
        and natural products, further enhancing my expertise in the field.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am a research assistant at the Life Science School, where I continue to engage in innovative research aimed at addressing challenges
        in microbiology and public health. I am passionate about advancing our understanding of microbial interactions and developing solutions that benefit society.</p>
